# Headphones Project

## Implement a design
Figma will be your friend!

During these projects, you won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

It’s not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

+ Reset CSS styling
+ Use variables
+ Simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
+ Avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
+ Simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
+ Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

## 0x09. Implement a design from scratch
<html>
<div class="panel panel-default" id="project-description">
 <div class="panel-body">
  <p>
   In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
